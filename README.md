### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction 

I am a geospatial remote sensing GIS analyst that worked in the sensing and IoT world of agriculture. This is my GitHub profile where hopefully I can showcase my current and completed projects. 



Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to better code in Python for geospatial usecases among lots of other things. 

Please view my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colekellow/) account for my full background.

## Projects
- Currently in the process of working on projects as well as learning new skills

- Here is my completion certificate for a Udemy course I completed on geospatial analysis using geopandas in python
